Aria
====

Aria is a render tests manager I've written while developping Castor3D.  
I've created its own repository to be able to extend it to any engine that could make use of it.  
It relies on DiffImage (provided in the repository) and on a test launcher that engine developer needs to write.  

Build Info

- DiffImageLib depends on wxWidgets.  
- DiffImage only depends on DiffImageLib.
